# Multifloor-Network-Infrastructure-with-VLAN-Segmentation-and-OSPF-Routing
This project presents the design, implementation, and testing of a segmented network infrastructure tailored for a multifloor organization. The organization's three-floor building is equipped with distinct departments, each requiring isolated network environments for optimal functionality. Through careful subnetting and VLAN configuration, the network achieves efficient departmental segmentation. The routers interconnecting the floors employ the OSPF routing protocol, facilitating seamless communication across the organization. Rigorous testing confirms the successful sharing of resources, including printers, internal web services, and SSH access. The implementation includes essential services such as DHCP, DNS, web, email, and file servers, ensuring a robust and fully functional network. The entire network design and configuration were carried out using Cisco Packet Tracer, a versatile tool for simulating network setups. The results indicate successful achievement of network objectives, meeting the organization's diverse requirements. This paper provides valuable insights into the design principles and testing methodologies employed, offering a comprehensive overview of the implemented network infrastructure.
